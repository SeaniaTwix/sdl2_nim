##  ===========

##  Cross-platform networking library.
##

##  Network Byte Order
##  ------------------
##  Also known as ``Big-Endian``. Which means the most significant byte comes
##  first in storage. Sparc and Motorola 68k based chips are MSB ordered.
##
##  ``Little-Endian`` (LSB) is stored in the opposite order, with the least
##  significant byte first in memory. Intel and AMD are two LSB machines.
##
##  For network addresses, 1.2.3.4 is always stored as `{0x01 0x02 0x03 0x04}`.

proc resolveHost*(address: ptr IPaddress; host: cstring; port: uint16): cint {.
    cdecl, importc: "SDLNet_ResolveHost", dynlib: SDL2_NET_LIB.}
  ##  Resolve a host name and port to an IP address in network form.
  ##
  ##  ``address`` points to the ``IPaddress`` that will be filled in.
  ##  It doesn't need to be set before calling this,
  ##  but it must be allocated in memory.
  ##
  ##  ``host`` For connecting to a server, this is the hostname or IP
  ##  in a string.
  ##
  ##  For becoming a server, this is `nil`.
  ##
  ##  If you do use `nil`, all network interfaces would be listened to for
  ##  incoming connections, using the `INADDR_ANY` address.
  ##
  ##  ``port`` For connecting to a server, this is the the servers listening
  ##  port number.
  ##
  ##  For becoming a server, this is the port to listen on.
  ##
  ##  If you are just doing Domain Name Resolution functions, this can be `0`.
  ##
  ##  Resolve the string ``host``, and fill in the ``IPaddress`` pointed to by
  ##  ``address`` with the resolved IP and the port number passed in through
  ##  ``port``.
  ##
  ##  This is the best way to fill in the ``IPaddress`` struct for later use.
  ##  This procedure does not actually open any sockets, it is used to prepare
  ##  the arguments for the socket opening procedures.
  ##
  ##  ``WARNING:`` this procedure will put the ``host`` and ``port``
  ##  into Network Byte Order into the ``address`` fields, so make sure
  ##  you pass in the data in your hosts byte order (normally not an issue).
  ##
  ##  ``Return`` `0` on success. `-1` on errors,
  ##  plus ``address.host`` will be `INADDR_NONE`.
  ##  An error would likely be that the address could not be resolved.
  ##
  ##  For a server listening on all interfaces, on port 1234:
  ##
  ##  .. code-block:: nim
  ##    # create a server type IPaddress on port 1234
  ##    var ipaddress: IPaddress
  ##    sdl_net.resolveHost(addr(ipaddress), nil, 1234)

  ##
  ##  .. code-block:: nim
  ##    # create an IPaddress for host name "host.domain.ext" on port 1234
  ##    # this is used by a client
  ##    var ipaddress: IPaddress

  ##


proc resolveIP*(address: ptr IPaddress): cstring {.
    cdecl, importc: "SDLNet_ResolveIP", dynlib: SDL2_NET_LIB.}
  ##  Resolve an ip address to a host name in canonical form.
  ##
  ##  ``address`` points to the ``IPaddress`` that will be resolved
  ##  to a host name. The ``address.port`` is ignored.
  ##
  ##  Resolve the IPv4 numeric address in ``address.host``,
  ##  and return the hostname as a string.
  ##
  ##  ``Note`` that this procedure is not thread-safe.
  ##
  ##  ``Return`` a valid char pointer (``cstring``) on success.
  ##  The returned hostname will have host and domain, as in "host.domain.ext".
  ##  `nil` is returned on errors, such as when it's not able to resolve
  ##  the host name. The returned pointer is not to be freed.
  ##  Each time you call this procedure the previous pointer's data will change
  ##  to the new value, so you may have to copy it into a local buffer to keep
  ##  it around longer.

  ##  with ``sdl_net.tcpOpen()``. Do not try to use any other procedures on
  ##  a closed socket, as it is now invalid.
  ##
  ##  ``Return`` nothing, this always succeeds for all we need to know.

  ##  This allows other systems to send to this socket via a known port.
  ##
  ##  Open a socket to be used for UDP packet sending and/or receiving.
  ##  If a non-zero port is given it will be used, otherwise any open port
  ##  number will be used automatically.
  ##
  ##  Unlike TCP sockets, this socket does not require a remote host IP to
  ##  connect to, this is because UDP ports are never actually connected like
  ##  TCP ports are. This socket is able to send and receive directly after
  ##  this simple creation.
  ##
  ##  ``Note`` that below I say server, but clients may also open a specific
  ##  port, though it is prefered that a client be more flexible, given that
  ##  the port may be already allocated by another process, such as a server.
  ##  In such a case you will not be able to open the socket, and your program
  ##  will be stuck, so it is better to just use whatever port you are given by
  ##  using a specified port of zero. Then the client will always work.
  ##  The client can inform the server what port to talk back to, or the server
  ##  can just look at the source of the packets it is receiving to know where
  ##  to respond to.
  ##
  ##  ``Return`` a valid ``UDPsocket`` on success. `nil` is returned on errors,
  ##  such as when it's not able to create a socket, or it cannot assign the
